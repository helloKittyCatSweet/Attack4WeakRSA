# Attack4WeakRSA  
This is a project for SC6104 **INTRODUCTION TO CRYPTOGRAPHY** of Blockchain in NTU. We find this topic interesting and hope to realize it in Python.  
We choose two papers to realize as listed in references parts.  
[1] In the paper, the author categorized attacks on RSA into four categories: (1) elementary attacks that exploit blatantmisuse of the system, (2) low private exponent attacks serious enough that a low private exponent should never be used, (3) low public exponent attacks, (4) and attacks on the implementation.  
I'd like to say this paper is quite a good resource that collects most of RSA-attack methods and elaborates them clearly.  
[2] Partial key exposure attack recovers full RSA private keys when significant key bits are leaked via side channels.
