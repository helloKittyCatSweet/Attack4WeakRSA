# Attack4WeakRSA  
This is a project for SC6104 **INTRODUCTION TO CRYPTOGRAPHY** of Blockchain in NTU. We find this topic interesting and hope to realize it in Java.  
In the paper, the author categorized attacks on RSA into four categories: (1) elementary attacks that exploit blatantmisuse of the system, (2) low private exponent attacks serious enough that a low private exponent should never be used, (3) low public exponent attacks, (4) and attacks on the implementation.  
I'd like to say this paper is quite a good resource that collects most of RSA-attack methods and elaborates them clearly.
