    """
    Improved Coppersmith attack for partial key exposure
    
    Uses lattice reduction to find small roots of polynomial modulo M.
    Given partial knowledge of private key d = d0 + x where |x| < X,
    recovers the unknown part x.
    
    Args:
        N: RSA modulus
        e: Public exponent
        d0: Known part of private key
        X: Upper bound on unknown part |x|
        M: Modulus for polynomial (typically Ï†(N))
        m: Lattice dimension parameter (higher = better but slower)
        t: Extra shift parameter (higher = better but slower)
        
    Returns:
        Recovered unknown part x, or None if attack fails
        
    Algorithm:
        1. Construct polynomial f(x) = e*x + (e*d0 - 1) mod M
        2. Build lattice from polynomial shifts
        3. Apply LLL reduction to find short vectors
        4. Extract and test roots from short vectors
